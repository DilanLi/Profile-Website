# Personal Profile

## Description

This repository is a portfolio website for Dilan Li, consisting of a About Me (index.html) page, a Portfolio page and a Contact Me page. The goal of this project is to create a responsive website utilizing Bootstrap 4 as well as preparing a draft portfolio for future use. The website intends to deliver satisfying layouts for viewers from xs to lg screens. 

## Hightlights

- I intend a simple layout that compliments the content without distraction
- I intend a calming color scheme that appears professional
- I intend to create most layouts and margins with built in Bootstrap 4 classes, some CSS was necessary for more detailed styling
- I was able to achieve the responsiveness without any media query
